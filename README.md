# Mnist-Dataset-
machine learning on famous dataset Mnist
1. Using only one digit to find out which machine learning algorithm will be the best fit for this dataset.
2. Using Confusion matrix to find out best precision and recall trade off for better perfromance of the model.
3. Using SVC(Support Vector Machine Classifer) on multiple class using OnevsRest method.
4. Error Analyzing for confusion matrix by plotting graphs.
5. Multioutput Classification using noise to make images more clearer.
